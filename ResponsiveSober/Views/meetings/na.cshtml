                Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings are based on the twelve (12)  step recovery model, which was founded in 1953. NA is based on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), which was founded in 1935,
                but NA is a fellowship for drug abusers and drug addicts. NA meetings are focused on topics related to drug abuse whereas AA meetings focus on alcoholism. The 12 step recovery model is the most widely
                utilized model for recovery in the world and is employed by over 90% of all treatment centers in the United States as part of their continuum of care and treatment center alumni are encouraged to continue
                to attend 12 step meetings for the rest of their lives to reduce the likelihood of relapse. Let's get started by selecting your geography:
